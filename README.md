# Cancer Prediction Project

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict cancer based on various features. It features a web application that allows users to upload data for cancer prediction.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aqib0770/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cancer-prediction
    ```

3. Create a virtual enviroment
    ```bash
    conda env create -p myenv python=3.8
    ```

4. Activate the conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```

5. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the web application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

Now, access the web application at `http://localhost:5000` and utilize the cancer prediction functionality.
